# library_manager_CLI


So I have removed the alpha version of this library manager from my github as it was outdated and it's compatibility was not too great either.


This is a simple Library management system made using Python programming Language and MongoDB Database. Since this is an open source repository, if anyone is willing to work on it then he/she is welcome to do so. Creating a GUI for the given system will be appreciated.
The program includes all such functions that a library does including the borrowing the books, returning the books, making query through books based on several parameters like Book name, Author name, Genre, Book code etc.
It also includes the real life scenario for what to do in case that a book is lost by a certrain candidate.
